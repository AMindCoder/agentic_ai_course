On 4 March, Google and XPrize announced a US $5 million prize to anyone who comes up with use cases for quantum computers. If that sounds like an admission that use cases don’t already exist, it isn’t, says Ryan Babbush, head of quantum algorithms at Google. “We do know of some applications that these devices would be quite impactful for,” he says. [...] A 2022 study from a collaboration between Google, Caltech, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and Microsoft has shown that if the output of a quantum sensor is instead funneled into a quantum computer, they can use a clever algorithm to learn relevant properties with exponentially fewer copies of the data from the sensor, speeding up readout. They demonstrated their quantum algorithm on a simulated sensor, showing that this algorithms is within reach for even currently existing quantum computers. [...] Since then, scientists have come up with ingenious algorithms to make quantum computers useful for non-quantum things, such as searching databases or breaking cryptography. However, the database search algorithms don’t promise viable speedups in the foreseeable future, and destroying Internet security seems like a dubious reason to build a new machine.But a recent study suggests that quantum computers will be able to simulate quantum phenomena of interest to several industries well before they',\n","   'score': 0.4851368}],\n"," 'search_depth': 'advanced'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
